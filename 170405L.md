**Merkle Tree**
- Inside the blocks, collection of transactions are stored in a binary tree , here the leaf node represents the transaction and each node represent a cryptographic hash of a transaction or another node.
- This approach helps in optimizing the storage (by truncating the old tree leaf nodes while keeping the proof of transaction) and search.

**Proof_Of_Work**
- PoW is one of the consensus mechanism used in (public) blockchains, here the miners competit to solve a computationally expensive puzzle( computing a nonce of given length to create a block hash with leading 'n' zeros ) .
